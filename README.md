###(HeartGuard AI (Heart Disease Prediction)

### **what i did**

i built an AI to predict if someone has heart problems. i used a medical dataset with things like age, cholesterol, and heart rate to train it.

### **the tech i used**

* **XGBoost:** this is the main "brain" that does the classification.
* **Optuna:** i used this to automatically tune the model so it gets the best score.
* **SMOTE:** the data was unbalanced, so i used this to make it fair for the AI.
* **StandardScaler:** i scaled the numbers so the AI doesn't get confused by big values.

### **my results**

* **Accuracy:** 99.9%
* **Key Findings:** the model showed that **chest pain type** and **max heart rate** are the biggest signs of heart disease.
